#Ground Up Fighting Game 
GUFG is an open-source, gameplay-focused 2D fighting game engine
developed from the bottom up.

The game is built using C++, SDL, and OpenGL without any RNGs.

##Building and testing GUFG
The current version of GUFG is currently only known to successfully build and run on Linux.

1. Install the dependencies, which are available in most Linux distribution
    package repositories, or can be compiled manually from source.
  * To build the native Linux client:
      * [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)
      * [SDL\_image](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
      * [SDL\_mixer](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
      * [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Linux)
      * [Glut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
      * [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
  * To cross compile for Windows (valid Fedora package names given):
      * mingw64-gcc-c++
      * mingw64-SDL
      * mingw64-SDL_image
      * mingw64-SDL_mixer
      * mingw64-freeglut

2. Clone this repository
  (`git clone git@github.com:Advael/GUFG.git`) 
    and `cd` to it.

3. Run `scons` to produce the default target: `./gufg`, an executable of the game.
   Other targets can be produced using `scons <target>` and include:
   * `bmpout`, a utility program to export bitmap images of
      character collision and hitboxes for moves.
   * `dist`, a directory containing the game and associated files,
     suitable for moving within the filesystem or including in an archive.
